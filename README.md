# ULTRA Globe

With this project, my goal is to bring Threejs users the capability to display OGC layers on a globe without needing to adopt specialized geospatial frameworks.

Currently, the code is limitted to a simple Globe with multileveled WMS tiles.

Limitations:
-No map reprojection (EPSG 4326 only). Mercator projections will probably work with some distortions
